\section{who I am and my objective:}

A motivated, curious and proactive developer with a passion for building
software with creative solutions. Currently, I'm working with agile, TDD, continuous integration and cloud,
so hope that I can help and learn more with the team.
I'm very interested in learning more about this position 
because ThoughWorks seems to be a place that fits in the way that I like to work.

    {{\normalfont Working at \textbf{FITec} as a Software Engineer,  I'm helping a team distributed in 3 countries
    to migrate an existing software, that handles with video processing, to the cloud (AWS). 
    We also are building Grails applications for this system that provides some cool features.
    We use current practices,
    methodologies and tools that give us a better way to do our deliveries faster and with more quality.
