            {{\normalfont I worked at \textbf{ThoughtWorks} as a consultant developer in different projects with different flavors.
            These projects involved the creation of dashboards and APIs as microservices to make reusable when creating new products.
            One of the roles that I played in the last one was to bring new practices and advocate for quality, bringing awareness about the subject for other members.
            Another cool project was a content management for a news site where the privacy and security in all aspects were considered as our first citizen.
