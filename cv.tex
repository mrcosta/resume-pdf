\section{Who I am:}

A motivated, curious and proactive developer with a passion for building software with creative solutions and that brings value and quality for who will use and maintain. I've been working in the last years with good practices of software development and new technologies. I read books, I follow blogs and participate in events. I also try to work in personal projects with the objective to test all these new acquired knowledge.
    \\\\Today, given my good experience with TDD and Tests, I'm studying a deeper level of the subject to understand where developers fail when using it. And regarding DDD and Design Patterns, I'm reinforcing my knowledge on it, because I consider an essential skill to write code that is really easy to read and maintain. I'm also playing a little with blockchains and advocating for privacy on the internet.
